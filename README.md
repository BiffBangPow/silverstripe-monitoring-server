## Silverstripe Monitoring System

### Client library


This module is built to work alongside the monitoring server system.

The module depends on a number of environment variables to function properly:

```
MONITORING_ENC_SECRET
MONITORING_ENC_SALT
MONITORING_API_KEY
MONITORING_VALID_IP
```

With the exception of the valid IP value, all the above variables will be generated by the server system.
These ensure that communications between the client and server are encrypted.

If set, the valid IP variable will restrict access to the monitoring system to those specified (IPV4).   IPs can be specified by a single address, an address range or a CIDR notation.
